# first assignment
# constant = 32
# fractionf = (9/5)
# fractionc = (5/9)
# for i in range(0,101,10):
#    x = (i * fractionf) + constant
#    print (i, x)
    
# second assignment
# F = eval(input("Please enter a temp in Fahrenheit:"))
# C = (F-constant) * fractionc
# print("The temp ",F, " is equal to ",C, " Celsius.")

# third assignment

# K = eval(input("Please enter a distance in kilometers:"))
# M = K * 0.62
# print(K, "kilometers is equal to ", M, " in miles.")
